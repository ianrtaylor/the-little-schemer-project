# Little Schemer Project
Ian Taylor, 2017

[The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer) is a classic programming book for the language Scheme.
This repo contains my exercise code and helper code (some of which is mine).
I'm implementing all code using [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) on a MacBook Pro.  


To play with the code I've written in `src`, run `./load`.
